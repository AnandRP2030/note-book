## Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage and allows developers to embed text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements. HTML is the foundation of web development and is essential for creating any website or web application.

### Key Features of HTML

- **Markup Language**: HTML uses a system of tags to describe the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, like `<tagname>`, and are usually paired to mark the beginning and end of an element.
- **Elements and Attributes**: HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. Each element can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. For example, `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">` includes `src` and `alt` attributes for the image element.
- **Semantic HTML**: Modern HTML emphasizes the use of semantic tags, which provide meaning to the content they enclose. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. Semantic HTML improves accessibility and SEO.
- **Cross-Platform**: HTML is a platform-independent language, meaning it can be used to create web pages that are accessible on any device with a web browser.

### Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document typically consists of the following structure:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>```
