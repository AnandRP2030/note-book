## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft and adds optional static types to JavaScript.

## Why Use TypeScript?

Here are some reasons why you might want to use TypeScript:

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript's type system helps catch errors early during development, making your code more robust and easier to maintain.
- **Improved IDE Support**: TypeScript provides excellent IntelliSense, code navigation, and refactoring capabilities, making your development experience more productive.
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: TypeScript includes all the latest JavaScript features and adds new ones, making it a superset of JavaScript.
- **Large Community**: With a strong community and backing from Microsoft, TypeScript has extensive documentation, tutorials, and third-party tools available.

## Getting Started

To start using TypeScript, you'll need to install it. You can do this via npm:

```sh
npm install -g typescript
```

After installing TypeScript, you can compile your `.ts` files to JavaScript using the `tsc` command:

```sh
tsc yourfile.ts
```

## Basic Types

TypeScript supports various basic types to help you define the structure of your variables:

```typescript
let isDone: boolean = true;
let decimal: number = 6;
let color: string = "blue";
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let tuple: [string, number] = ["hello", 10];
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }
let c: Color = Color.Green;
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces define the shape of objects. They are a powerful way to define contracts within your code:

```typescript
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
}

function greeter(person: Person) {
    return `Hello, ${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`;
}

let user = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };
console.log(greeter(user));
```

## Classes

TypeScript supports object-oriented programming with classes, including inheritance, access modifiers, and more:

```typescript
class Animal {
    name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    move(distance: number = 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distance}m.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    bark() {
        console.log("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.bark();
dog.move(10);
```

## Modules

Modules in TypeScript help you organize your code into reusable components. You can export and import functionalities:

```typescript
// math.ts
export function add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
}

// main.ts
import { add } from './math';

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8
```

## Advanced Features

TypeScript also includes many advanced features, such as:

- **Generics**: Write functions and classes that work with any type.
- **Decorators**: Special annotations that can modify classes and their members.
- **Type Inference**: Automatically infer types based on the code context.
- **Union and Intersection Types**: Create complex types by combining simpler ones.
